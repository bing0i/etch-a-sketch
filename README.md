# Etch-a-Sketch
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project). A square will be filled when the mouse hovers on it.
A square will be also darker if the mouse hovers on it again. You can change number of squares and have a sketch when playing with it.
